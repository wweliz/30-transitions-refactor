AUTHOR: Whitney Williams<br>
REPO NAME: 30-transitions-refactor<br>

===============================================================================

This page is a refactor of my "30-transitions" repo, and uses SASS And nesting
to clean up and simplify my CSS effects and transitions; it was completed while
I was a student in The Iron Yard's Front End Engineeering course.
